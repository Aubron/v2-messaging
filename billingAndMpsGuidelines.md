# V2 Messaging Billing and MPS Guidelines

Sending SMS and single recipient MMS are billed and added to your MPS (message per second) limit the same way in V2 messaging as they are in V1 messaging. Sending group MMS is billed and added to your MPS limit per recipient of the group MMS.

V1 messaging rate limit documentation can be found [here](https://dev.bandwidth.com/ap-docs/rateLimits/messageRateLimits.html), and billing/pricing information can be found [here](https://www.bandwidth.com/pricing/).
